Most of us are based at [Aarhus University](https://au.dk) in Denmark. We are part of the [Section for Ecoinformatics and Biodiversity](http://bios.au.dk/en/about-bioscience/organisation/ecoinformatics-and-biodiversity/), which belongs to the [Department of Bioscience](http://bios.au.dk/en/).

The section is where our daily lives take place. It consists of six faculty members and numerous postdocs and students working a diverse array of biodiversity-related [topics](http://bios.au.dk/en/about-bioscience/organisation/ecoinformatics-and-biodiversity/ecoinformatics-researchprofile/). This diversity is a treasure trove for integrative research – if you do not watch out, you suddenly find yourself co-authoring a [paper on birds](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ele.12285/abstract)! The section is an important forum for discussing our science, be it at our weekly seminar series or less formally over lunch, coffee or an after-work beer. We also have a good tradition of social activities (such as camping, canoeing, or just a quick game of pool), making it easier for new starters to become part of our scientific family.

With >40’000 students, including many from abroad, [Aarhus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aarhus) is a young, international and liveable city. Despite its moderate size, it has lots to offer throughout the seasons, outdoors or indoors. This is illustrated by the fact that Aarhus was chosen as the European Capital of Culture 2017. Moving to Aarhus is easy – if you decide to join our team from abroad, you will find that there are many ways to find help and advice, e.g. from Aarhus University’s [International Centre](http://www.au.dk/en/internationalcentre/), or the [International Citizen Service](http://icitizen.dk/). Once you have moved, the [International Community](https://internationalcommunity.dk/) can help you and your family settle in.

Although our main affiliation is with Aarhus University, we maintain close ties with the [Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew](https://www.kew.org/). With >8 million botanical specimens and >300 scientists, Kew is a global hub of plant diversity research and a crucial partner in much of our research.
