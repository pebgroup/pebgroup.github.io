# Welcome!
We are the Plant Evolution and Biodiversity Group (PEB for short). We have our headquarters at [Aarhus University](https://bios.au.dk) in Denmark, and a "side branch" at the [Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew](https://www.kew.org/science) in the UK. We are a group of scientists at various career stages united by our interest in... well, what it says on the tin. However, the P in PEB also stands for Phylogeny, because we mostly look at biodiversity from a phylogenetic angle, and producing and using phylogenetic trees is a key element of what we do. Oh, and the B in PEB also stands for Biogeography: most of our work is done within an explicit geographic framework. Please feel free to have a browse through our site to learn more about what we do.
