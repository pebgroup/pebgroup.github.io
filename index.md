We are the Plant Evolution and Biodiversity Group (short: PEB). We have our headquarters at [Aarhus University](https://bios.au.dk) in Denmark, and a "side branch" at the [Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew](https://www.kew.org/science) in the UK. We are a group of scientists at various career stages sharing an interest in... well, what it says on the tin. However, the P in PEB also stands for Phylogeny, because we mostly look at biodiversity from a phylogenetic angle, and producing and using phylogenetic trees is a key element of what we do. Oh, and the B in PEB also stands for Biogeography: most of our work is done within an explicit geographic framework. Please feel free to have a browse through our site to learn more about what we do. 

This site is currently under construction. If you cannot find what you are looking for, please don't hesitate to [drop us a line](mailto:wolf.eiserhardt@bios.au.dk)! 

*Why plants?*

We all depend on them, but we rarely think about them. Plants produce the oxygen we breathe, the food we eat, and many of the construction materials, commodities and medicines that our society is built on. Yet, we still do not really understand them.

There are about 400’000 known species of land plants. Very few of them (such as major crops) have been studied in great detail, but for most plant species we barely know they exist. And there may be another 80’000 or so that remain to be discovered. How and why has this diversity evolved? What is its function in nature, and why should we care about it?

Driven by those big questions, we study the “neglected” part of plant diversity using a variety of approaches including genomics, phylogenetics, macroevolution, comparative biology, biogeography, macroecology, community ecology, and taxonomy.
