title: "Integrated monography of the genus Saxifraga L. 
as a window on the evolution of the European Alpine flora"
categories: projects

This project aims to use the species-rich, predominantly alpine genus Saxifraga (ca. 440 spp.) as a model to elucidate the eco-evolutionary assembly of mountain floras, with emphasis on the European Alps. 

The project is funded by the David & Claudia Harding Foundation 2016-2019.
