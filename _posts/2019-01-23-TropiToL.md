title: "Explaining the biological hyperdiversity of Tropical rainforests using the Tree of Life (TropiToL)"
categories: projects
---

The tropical rainforest is the biologically richest nature on earth, harbouring 50% of all living species, for unknown reasons. This mysterious richness can be explained using the Tree of Life, which shows the evolutionary history of species. We will reconstruct the Tree of Life for plants, and use it for the first time to explain the richness of rainforests at a global scale. This grant will recruit four researchers to work together on solving this long-standing biological riddle.

TropiToL is funded by [VILLUM fonden](https://veluxfoundations.dk/en/about/fondsfamilien) 2019-2023.
