Our research targets the evolutionary processes driving the dynamics of biodiversity across space, time and the Tree of Life. Our empirical work mainly focuses on plants, but we are interested in collaborations on other organisms as well. Our work integrates across a broad range of methods. We generate taxonomic knowledge, trait data, genomic data, and eco-geographic data using a combination of collections-based research, field research, and data mining. Using phylogenomic, macroevolutionary, macroecological and biogeographic approaches, we test hypotheses that are central to our understanding of biodiversity.
